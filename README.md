## Geez Calendar

The aim of this project is to make a convenient Geez calendar for people who are not fluent in other languages like Amharic or English 
and are in need of the Geez calendar traditionally used in Eritrea and Ethiopia.

## Language
for now #Java, I am using Joda time for converting between Geez and Gregorian Dates.

## layout

this Calendar is designed with the traditional mobile calendar UI in mind, where scrolling left and right changes months that are displayed on screen
and the displayed months events are listed below.
