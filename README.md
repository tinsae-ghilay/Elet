## Geez Calendar
The aim of this project is to make a convinient Geez calendar for people who are not fluent in other languages like Amharic or English 
and are in need of the Geez calendar tradtionally used in Eritrea and Ethiopia.

## Language
#Java
for now, I am using Joda time for converting between Geez and Gregorian Dates.

## layout

this Calendar is designed with the traditional mobile calendar UI in mind, where scrolling left and right changes months that are displayed on screen
and the displayed monhs events are listed below.

## Contributions

any sugestion is welcome.contact information will be provided here when I set up a separate email for this purpose.
